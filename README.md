📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles and social media posts as Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system uses TF-IDF for feature extraction and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for prediction. An interactive Streamlit web application is developed for real-time news classification.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NLTK
Scikit-learn
TF-IDF Vectorization
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Streamlit

▶️ How to Run
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn streamlit joblib
python model_training.py
streamlit run App.py

⚠️ Note
The model classifies news based on linguistic patterns and may not always reflect factual correctness.

🚀 Future Scope
Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
Multi-language support
Improved accuracy with larger datasets
